/** 
 * Basic JavaScript: Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
 */

 // The remainder operator % gives us the remainder of the division of two numbers.
 // Example:
 console.log(5 % 2);
console.log(Math.floor(5 / 2));
console.log(2 * 2);
console.log(5 - 4);

// Usage
// in mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.
if ((48%2) ==1){
    console.log('Odd');
} else if((48%2)==0){
    console.log('Even');
}

// Note:
// The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. it similar to modulus, but does not work with negative numbers.

// Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.

let remainder = 11 % 3;
let answer = 11 / 2;
